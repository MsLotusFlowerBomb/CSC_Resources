A company stored a secret message on a server which got breached due to the admin using weakly hashed passwords. Can you gain access to the secret stored within the server? 

Access the server using nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 53299

so i was provided this hash: 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38

i used hasid to identify as MD5
- I opened up wordlists and extracted rockyou.txt 
- i opened up hashcat and used rockyou.txt to attack the hash.
 
$hashcat -a 0 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38 ./usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
--i need to move the rockyou file in sudo mode:
$ sudo mv /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ~/Documents/CSC/forensics/hashcrack

--great now run the attack again and wait.
-- i received an error because I forgot to include the hash mode, lets try again...
	$ hashcat -a 0 -m 0 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38 ./rockyou.txt

IT TAKES TIME!

*use --show to reveal the password

i got password123 which gave me another hash...(sha1) 
i got letmein which gave a longer hash (sha256)

finally flag revealed as : picoCTF{UseStr0nG_h@shEs_&PaSswDs!_23622a7e}
