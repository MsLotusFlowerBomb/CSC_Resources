Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915

hint: what part of the website could tell you where the creator doesnt want you to look?


*solution*

ok so immediately robots sticks out because i recently learned about robots.txt, a file with info not to be indexed.. lets start there.

ok i see another html file... /8028f.html
opened the file and found the flag... picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8028f}
