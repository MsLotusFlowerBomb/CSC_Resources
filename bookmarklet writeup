BOOKMARKLET

so we need to find the flag which is encrypted. upon inspection, source code reveals a js function to decrypt the flag and display as an alert.
2. I need to run this script. but how?
3. i'm guessing this has something to do with bookmarks, let me research.
4. upon research i found that you can run js  scripts directly in the url when adding a new bookmark... let me try.

5. I added a new bookmark named bookmarklet, pasted the clipboard content in url and saved and alert with flag popped up.
