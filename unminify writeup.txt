UNMINIFY
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

1. initially i thought im looking for a zip or tar file, so i viewed page source

2. code had picoctf{} as a class and all code was on one line so i went through it.
flag was a class name in ascii. easy
